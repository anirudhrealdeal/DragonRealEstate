# DragonRealEstate
Machine Learning model to predict the price of a house taking a few parameters like crime rate, number of rooms etc. Uses a pre-existing dataset from the UCI ML repository for training the model<br>
There's a training file- dragonrealestate.ipynb <br>
There's also a testing file- ModelUsage.ipynb<br>
This project helped me understand the basics of machine learning and got me a better understanding about regressors<br>
Happy Coding!!
